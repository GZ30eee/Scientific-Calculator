# HTML Scientific Calculator

A simple and clean scientific calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is fully responsive and provides a variety of mathematical operations and functions, including basic arithmetic, complex operations, trigonometric functions, and more. The layout is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Complex Functions**: Logarithmic functions, square roots, trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan).
- **Advanced Functions**: Factorial, power, pi, and more.
- **Responsive Layout**: Adjusts to different screen sizes (including mobile devices).
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple, clean, and easy-to-use design.

## Installation

To use this calculator, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in a browser.

### Steps:
1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GZ30eee/scientific-calculator.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

No server or additional setup is required.

## Usage

1. **Basic Calculation**: Use the number buttons (0-9) to input numbers, and use the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
2. **Advanced Operations**: Use functions like `ln` (logarithm), `√` (square root), and `x^2` (square) for more advanced calculations.
3. **Trigonometric Functions**: Use `sin`, `cos`, and `tan` to perform trigonometric calculations.
4. **Memory Functions**: The `C` button clears the screen.

### Example:
- To calculate `3 + 5`, click the buttons `3`, `+`, and `5`, and then click `=`.
- For `sin(30)`, click `sin`, then `3`, `0`, and click `=`.
- To calculate square root of 25, click `√`, then `2`, `5`, and click `=`.

## Styling

The calculator has been styled using custom CSS. It uses a clean and minimalistic design with rounded corners, padding, and subtle hover effects.

### Media Query Support:
The layout is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablets, and mobile devices). The calculator input and buttons are sized appropriately for different devices.

### Customization:
You can easily customize the look and feel of the calculator by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file.

## Technologies Used
